<h1>about me</h1>
- hey, im @tivvo / tiv, i made this account orignally for school but now use it permenantely for personal projects since it took a good 4 moths to link my actual accounts, if you're one of my friends and somehow find this, well good for you. i guess? <br>

- **this is used as a school + personal account, please note that 90% of my repositories are private!** <br>
- `some repositories are used by argon or rojo, for experimenting w/ games or simply having a sync` <br>
